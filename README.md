# SemEval2k19-Task4-UMD

There are 3 files, the 'generate_vectors.py' and 'generate_sentiment_vectors.py' are used to create unigram/image presence and sentiment vectors respectively. The 'classify.py' is used for training and testing the SVM, Gaussian NB and Decision Tree classifiers.

There are no output files for the last one as the results are displayed directly in the terminal. For the first 2, the results are stored as '.csv' files. In order to run the classification program, the 2 output files from the first 2 programs are manually merged into files called 'train.csv' and 'test.csv'.

The first few lines of each program are commented out. They are simply the command line arguments I used to run the program. You can change it accordingly to where you have kept your files.
